# HTCShiftX9500Lubuntu
Install notes for Lubuntu 18.10 on HTC Shift X9500

##Steps

1. Download [Lubunu 18.10](https://lunbuntu.me) and create an installable boot image using something Like [Unetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

2. Ensure you have a USB Hub as you will that can accommodate the USB Boot Disk and Micro Wifi USB (The default Marvell Adaptor will not be recognised).

3. Start the Shift and Press F10 on startup to get to the boot menu and choose the USB Boot

4. Choose to start Lubuntu

5. Once Lubuntu has started, connect to a Wifi network (assuming that your micro USB Wifi card is recognised - Lubuntu is pretty good at recognising modern day cards. I used one that was lying around that I had used for my Raspberry Pi)

6. Once Wifi is setup then choose to install Lubuntu.

7. When navigating the installer screen you will not be able to click the 'Next' button to get to the next screen of the installer because it is not visible. Press Alt and left mouse click and then move the screen up so you can see the buttons and proceed.
